# IPFS Deployment Troubleshooting

## Network Connectivity Issues

Based on the retrievability test, your IPFS pinning service is experiencing connectivity challenges with the broader IPFS network.

### Identified Issues:
- **Connection Failures**: Node cannot establish connections to other IPFS peers
- **Dial Backoff**: Multiple connection attempts are failing
- **Circuit Relay Issues**: P2P circuit connections are not working

### Current Mitigation Strategies:

#### 1. Enhanced Gateway Seeding
The deployment now seeds content through 6 major IPFS gateways:
- ipfs.io
- dweb.link  
- cf-ipfs.com
- gateway.pinata.cloud
- cloudflare-ipfs.com
- w3s.link

#### 2. Extended Propagation
- Multiple DHT announcements (3 rounds)
- Extended 2-minute propagation period
- Connections to reliable public IPFS nodes

#### 3. Comprehensive Verification
- Tests accessibility across multiple gateways
- Verifies content integrity
- Reports accessibility status

### Recommendations for Your Pinning Service:

#### Network Configuration:
```bash
# Check firewall settings
sudo ufw status

# Ensure IPFS ports are open
sudo ufw allow 4001/tcp
sudo ufw allow 4001/udp

# Check IPFS daemon connectivity
ipfs swarm peers
ipfs id
```

#### Bootstrap Configuration:
```bash
# Add reliable bootstrap nodes
ipfs bootstrap add /dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN
ipfs bootstrap add /dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmQCU2EcMqAqQPR2i9bChDtGNJchTbq5TbXJJ16u19uLTa

# Restart daemon
ipfs daemon --enable-gc
```

#### NAT/Router Configuration:
- Port forward 4001 (TCP/UDP) to your IPFS node
- Configure UPnP if available
- Check if your ISP blocks P2P traffic

### Alternative Solutions:

#### 1. Use Public Pinning Services
Consider using established pinning services as backup:
- Pinata
- Web3.Storage
- Fleek

#### 2. Multiple Node Setup
Run multiple IPFS nodes in different locations for redundancy.

#### 3. Gateway-First Strategy
The current deployment prioritizes gateway seeding over P2P connectivity, which should work even with connectivity issues.

### Monitoring Commands:

```bash
# Check node connectivity
ipfs swarm peers | wc -l

# Test content retrieval
ipfs cat <HASH>/index.html

# Check DHT providers
ipfs dht findprovs <HASH>

# Monitor bandwidth
ipfs stats bw
```

### Current Status:
The deployment workflow has been enhanced to work around connectivity issues by:
- Seeding through multiple gateways
- Extended propagation periods
- Comprehensive accessibility testing
- Fallback strategies

Content should still be accessible via IPFS gateways even if P2P connectivity is limited.
