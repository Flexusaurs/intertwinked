# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the main CLI-style interface of the Intertwinked P2P communication platform. The interface provides a terminal-like experience in the browser with a peer sidebar, tabbed chat system, and theme toggle functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all currently connected peers in a sidebar, so that I can quickly identify who is available for communication.

2. WHEN a peer is online THEN the system SHALL display their nickname with a green dot indicator (●)
3. WHEN a peer is offline THEN the system SHALL display their nickname with an empty circle indicator (○)
4. WHEN a peer identity is destroyed THEN the system SHALL mark them as "DEAD" with strikethrough text and red X indicator (✗)
5. WHEN there are more peers than fit in the viewport THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling functionality
6. WHEN a peer's status changes THEN the system SHALL update their indicator in real-time

### Requirement 2

6. WHEN there are unread messages in a tab THEN the system SHALL display a count indicator (3)
7. WHEN the user wants to close a tab THEN the system SHALL provide a close mechanism

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to look like a CLI terminal, so that I have a familiar and focused interface for communication.

2. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL use ASCII characters for borders and visual separation
3. WHEN showing the layout THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent grid-based spacing
4. WHEN rendering text THEN the system SHALL align all content on a character grid
5. WHEN displaying interactive elements THEN the system SHALL use bracket-style buttons [Submit]
6. WHEN showing input fields THEN the system SHALL display them with terminal-style cursor indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark themes, so that I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL default to dark mode theme

3. WHEN the theme is changed THEN the system SHALL persist the preference in local storage
4. WHEN the application reloads THEN the system SHALL restore the user's preferred theme
5. WHEN in dark mode THEN the system SHALL use terminal-appropriate dark colors
6. WHEN in light mode THEN the system SHALL use high-contrast light colors
7. WHEN switching themes THEN the system SHALL maintain accessibility contrast ratios

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and interact with chat messages in an expanded chat area, so that I can have meaningful conversations with peers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN the user types a message THEN the system SHALL show a terminal-style input prompt
4. WHEN there are many messages THEN the system SHALL provide scrollable message history
5. WHEN a new message arrives THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show it
6. WHEN the user is typing THEN the system SHALL show typing indicators to other peers
7. WHEN messages fail to send THEN the system SHALL display error indicators with retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be responsive across different devices, so that I can use the application on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

6. WHEN the interface adapts THEN the system SHALL maintain the CLI aesthetic across all breakpoints

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want full keyboard navigation support, so that I can use the application efficiently without a mouse.
